If you're reading this, then that means you took the time to actually set up the repository for the 2nd year code that you made for the entirety of the 3 trimesters.
Good job. Hopefully you keep on adding more stuff, okay? Good.

Don't forget to add the .vscode folder and the settings.json in the folder.

Git Commands:

init = "create the repository"

add = "stages a  file that will be committed inside the repository"

commit = "committing the file into the repository" NOTE: -m must follow up with the commit message inside quotation marks, otherwise VSC will open an editor and ask for the commit message.

push = "pushes the offline local repository into the online repository at the github repository"

branch = "creates a screenshot of the repository"

merge = "combines the screenshot into the main MASTER repository"

log = "checks each and every commits in the history of the repository"

status = "checks if there are uncommitted files and other statuses from the repository"

pull = "fetches from a branch or screenshot of the repository"

Alternatively, you can use the GitHub Desktop application. It makes things easier and more accesible.
